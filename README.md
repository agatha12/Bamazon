# Bamazon

Bamazon is a command line application that uses node to connect to a mysql database houseing "store inventory". It is basically an inventory tracking system with a customer interface where on can "place an order". 

The customer view pulls up a list of available items for the customer and the prompts them to choose and item by number and enter a quantity of that item that they would like to purchase. It then either lets the customer know that their order was successful and displays their outstanding balance or, it will tell them there is and insufficent stock to fulfill their order and let them know how many of that item the store has in stock. 

The manager view allows the user to view the products, add inventory, add a new product and view low inventory (below 100 units)

The supervisor view allows the user to track sales and profits by department, as well as, add new departments.
